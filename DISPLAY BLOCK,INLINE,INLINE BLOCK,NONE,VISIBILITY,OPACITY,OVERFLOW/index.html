      Kaecilius uses the stolen pages to contact Dormammu of the Dark Dimension,
      where time is non-existent, and destroys the London Sanctum to weaken
      Earth's protection. The zealots then attack the New York Sanctum, killing
      its guardian, but Strange holds them off with the help of the Cloak of
      Levitation, only to be critically injured during a skirmish. He teleports
      himself back to the hospital where Palmer saves him. Upon returning to the
      Sanctum, Strange reveals to Mordo that the Ancient One has been drawing
      power from the Dark Dimension to sustain long life, and Mordo becomes
      disillusioned with her. After a fight in the Mirror Dimension of New York,
      Kaecilius mortally wounds the Ancient One and escapes to Hong Kong. Before
      dying, she tells Strange that he and Mordo will have to work together to
      defeat Kaecilius, balancing Mordo's steadfast nature against Strange's
      willingness to bend the rules. Strange and Mordo arrive in Hong Kong to
      find Wong dead, the Sanctum destroyed, and the Dark Dimension engulfing
      Earth. Strange uses the Eye to reverse time and save Wong, then enters the
      Dark Dimension and creates an endless time loop around himself and
      Dormammu. After repeatedly killing Strange to no avail, Dormammu finally
      accepts his bargain, leaving Earth permanently and taking Kaecilius and
      the zealots with him in exchange for Strange breaking the loop.Disgusted
      by Strange and the Ancient One defying nature's laws, Mordo renounces his
      sorcerer career and departs. Strange returns the Eye, which is revealed to
      hold an Infinity Stone, back to Kamar-Taj and takes up residence in the
      New York Sanctum to continue his studies with Wong. In a mid-credits

      Spider-Man is secret identity of Peter Benjamin Parker. Initially, Peter
      was depicted as a teenage high-school student and an orphan raised by his
      Aunt May and Uncle Ben in New York City after his parents, Richard and
      Mary Parker, died in a plane crash. Lee, Ditko, and later creators had the
      character deal with the struggles of adolescence and young adulthood and
      gave him many supporting characters, such as Flash Thompson, J. Jonah
      Jameson, and Harry Osborn; romantic interests Gwen Stacy, Mary Jane
      Watson, and the Black Cat; and enemies such as Doctor Octopus, the Green
      Goblin, and Venom. In his origin story, Peter gets his superhuman spider
      powers and abilities after being bitten by a radioactive spider. These
      powers include superhuman strength, agility, reflexes, stamina,
      durability, coordination, and balance; clinging to surfaces and ceilings
      like a spider; and detecting danger with his precognition ability called
      "spider-sense". He builds wrist-mounted "web-shooter" devices that shoot
      artificial spider-webs of his own design, which he uses both for fighting
      and travel, or webswing across the city. Peter Parker initially used his
      powers for his personal gain, but after his Uncle Ben was killed by a
      thief that Peter could not stop, he began to use his powers to fight crime
      by becoming Spider-Man. Spider-Man is secret identity of Peter Benjamin

      In 2012, Odin sends Thor back to Earth using dark magic after learning
      Loki is alive and is attempting to conquer the Earth. He finds Loki on a
      Quinjet, held captive by Tony Stark, Steve Rogers, and Natasha Romanoff.
      Thor takes Loki away, hoping to convince him to abandon his plan. However,
      Stark and Rogers pursue Thor and after a brief confrontation, Thor agrees
      to take Loki to S.H.I.E.L.D.'s flying aircraft carrier, the Helicarrier.
      Agents including Clint Barton, who were mind controlled by Loki, attack
      the Helicarrier, disabling one of its engines in flight and causing Bruce
      Banner to transform into the Hulk. Thor attempts to stop the Hulk's
      rampage and both are ejected from the Helicarrier as Loki escapes. Thor
      then becomes a founding member of the Avengers upon returning to help
      Rogers, Stark, Banner, Romanoff, and Barton when Loki uses the Tesseract
      to open a wormhole over New York City to allow a Chitauri army to invade.
      Thor and the Avengers fight off the Chitauri and save the city. After Loki
      is defeated at Stark Tower, Thor returns to Asgard with Loki and the
      Tesseract. In 2013, having used the Tesseract to rebuild the Bifrost and
      bring the Nine Realms to peace, Thor and his fellow warriors learn that
      the Convergence of the realms is imminent, with portals linking the worlds
      appearing at random. Heimdall alerts Thor that Jane Foster has left his
      near all-seeing vision, leading Thor to go to Earth. Jane inadvertently
      releases an unearthly force, and Thor returns with her to Asgard. Odin
      recognizes this force as a weapon known as the Aether, warning that it
      will kill Jane, and that its return heralds a catastrophic prophecy. The
      Dark Elves, led by Malekith, attack Asgard, searching for Jane. Thor's
      mother Frigga is killed protecting Jane, and Malekith is forced to flee.
      Against Odin's orders to stay in Asgard, Thor reluctantly frees Loki, who
      knows a secret portal to Svartalfheim, home of the Dark Elves, in return
      for Thor's promise to take vengeance for their mother. In Svartalfheim,
      Loki tricks Malekith into drawing the Aether out of Jane, but Thor's
      attempt to destroy the exposed substance fails. Malekith merges with the
      Aether and leaves in his ship as Loki is fatally wounded. Thor and Jane
      return to London through another portal. Thor ultimately defeats Malekith
      in a battle in Greenwich, and returns to Asgard to decline Odin's offer to
      take the throne, and tells Odin of Loki's sacrifice. Thor then returns to

      Loki is alive and is attempting to conquer the Earth. He finds Loki on a
      Quinjet, held captive by Tony Stark, Steve Rogers, and Natasha Romanoff.
      Thor takes Loki away, hoping to convince him to abandon his plan. However,
      Stark and Rogers pursue Thor and after a brief confrontation, Thor agrees
      to take Loki to S.H.I.E.L.D.'s flying aircraft carrier, the Helicarrier.
      Agents including Clint Barton, who were mind controlled by Loki, attack
      the Helicarrier, disabling one of its engines in flight and causing Bruce
      Banner to transform into the Hulk. Thor attempts to stop the Hulk's
      rampage and both are ejected from the Helicarrier as Loki escapes. Thor
      then becomes a founding member of the Avengers upon returning to help
      Rogers, Stark, Banner, Romanoff, and Barton when Loki uses the Tesseract
      to open a wormhole over New York City to allow a Chitauri army to invade.
      Thor and the Avengers fight off the Chitauri and save the city. After Loki
      is defeated at Stark Tower, Thor returns to Asgard with Loki and the
      Tesseract. In 2013, having used the Tesseract to rebuild the Bifrost and
      bring the Nine Realms to peace, Thor and his fellow warriors learn that
      the Convergence of the realms is imminent, with portals linking the worlds
      appearing at random. Heimdall alerts Thor that Jane Foster has left his
      near all-seeing vision, leading Thor to go to Earth. Jane inadvertently
      releases an unearthly force, and Thor returns with her to Asgard. Odin
      recognizes this force as a weapon known as the Aether, warning that it
      will kill Jane, and that its return heralds a catastrophic prophecy. The
      Dark Elves, led by Malekith, attack Asgard, searching for Jane. Thor's
      mother Frigga is killed protecting Jane, and Malekith is forced to flee.
      Against Odin's orders to stay in Asgard, Thor reluctantly frees Loki, who
      knows a secret portal to Svartalfheim, home of the Dark Elves, in return
      for Thor's promise to take vengeance for their mother. In Svartalfheim,
      Loki tricks Malekith into drawing the Aether out of Jane, but Thor's
      attempt to destroy the exposed substance fails. Malekith merges with the
      Aether and leaves in his ship as Loki is fatally wounded. Thor and Jane
      return to London through another portal. Thor ultimately defeats Malekith
      in a battle in Greenwich, and returns to Asgard to decline Odin's offer to
      take the throne, and tells Odin of Loki's sacrifice. Thor then returns to
      Earth and reunites with Jane.
